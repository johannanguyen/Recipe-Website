<b>Technical Issues I encountered:</b><br>
    Originally, I attempted to grab Tweets by starting a stream. It was difficult to work with because the
    stream was endless and I was unable to stop the stream just after one (or even a few) tweets. I eventually
    had the stream come to a halt after 1 second, but that still returned ~200 results. I solved this issue
    by realizing I needed to switch gears and pull tweets in a way that I could properly handle. By using
    tweepy's api.search and Cursor features, I was able to grab exactly the number of tweet objects I wanted
    as well as specific pieces of information from each. The resources I used to achieve this are as follows:<br>
        <b>Standard Search API:</b> <br>
            https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/tweets/search/api-reference/get-search-tweets<br>
        <b>Twitter API with Python: Part 2 -- Cursor and Pagination by LucidProgramming:</b> <br>
            https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhBZqEWsZU4&t=1067s<br><br>
    Another hardship I faced was relating the tweets to dishes that were being generated by the Spoonacular
    API. Initially, I was pulling the recipes randomly and tried to merge the recipe title to the list of
    tweets I pulled. This was tricky because some of the recipe titles included "How to Make..." which threw
    my tweet search off. I ultimately created a list of hard-coded food items. From this list, I was able to
    run both the tweet and recipe search successfully without worrying if they were going to relate to
    each other or not.<br><br>
    After switching gears from pulling random recipes to instead hard-coding a list of food items and randomly
    selecting from there, I had to in turn change the API calls for the recipe. It was mostly difficult
    for me to grab the list of ingredients. After reading through the Spoonacular docs, I found that I was
    able to achieve this by splitting the food portion of app into two different API calls:<br>
        <b>Complex Search:</b><br>
            https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/complexSearch<br>
        <b>Get Recipe Information:</b><br>
            https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/{id}/information<br>
    The Complex Search provided the food id for a specific dish, which I then included in the Get Recipe
    Information call to obtain the other desired components, including the list of ingredients.<br>
        
<b>Remaining Issues / Additional Features:</b><br>
    Although there are no known remaining issues with my app, there are a few bells and whistles I would
    like to implement. Although organized, the app looks flat and stagnant. This is due to the lack of
    movement displayed on the page. Adding multiple images and animations would help the app by adding
    interesting visuals. Furthermore, this app is completely based on random selection and therefore
    does not incur any user input. I would like to enhance the user experience by providing a search
    function - by dish name, by ingredient, or by dish type (keto, vegan, etc).
