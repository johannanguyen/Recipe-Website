Technical Issues I encountered:
    Originally, I attempted to grab Tweets by starting a stream. It was difficult to work with because the
    stream was endless and I was unable to stop the stream just after one (or even a few) tweets. I eventually
    had the stream come to a halt after 1 second, but that still returned ~200 results. I solved this issue
    by realizing I needed to switch gears and pull tweets in a way that I could properly handle. By using
    tweepy's api.search and Cursor features, I was able to grab exactly the number of tweet objects I wanted
    as well as specific pieces of information from each.
    Another hardship I faced was relating the tweets to dishes that were being generated by the Spoonacular
    API. Initially, I was pulling the recipes randomly and tried to merge the recipe title to the list of
    tweets I pulled. This was tricky because some of the recipe titles included "How to Make..." which threw
    my tweet search off. I ultimately created a list of hard-coded food items. From this list, I was able to
    run both the tweet and recipe search successfully without worrying if they were going to relate to
    each other or not.

Remaining Issues:
    I am currently grabbing recipe and source data separately, but by using the same API call twice. I will be
    able to have both field populatings correctly with a single API call by parsing the json files more carefully
    as well as making the overall code more modular.
